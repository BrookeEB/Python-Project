Final Project for Python 2017

# The Walking Dead Trivia Quiz!

Made by Brooke Bartlett 

# Why I wanted to do a trivia quiz:

For this python project, I wanted to code something fun and something that I thought everyone would have some knowledge about. So, I 
coded a trivia quiz based on AMC's "The Walking Dead" TV show. Everyone loves zombies!

# What the project is:

The project is a Trivia quiz based off the popular AMC TV show "The Walking Dead". The quiz covers seasons up to 7. Each question is 
given 5 options to choose from with only one option being correct.

# How the program works:

The program uses classes, loops, if and else statements and the randomize function to output the questions along with the answers.
The program first asks the user what their name is before printing welcoming them to the trivia quiz. Questions are placed into a class 
system to store the questions that will be asked along with the answers to each. Loops run through the class and print the questions. 
The if and else statements will output the answers to the question depending on the user's answer to the question printed. The loops 
will run back through the question after an answer has been chosen by the user and will either notify the user that they are got the 
question correct or incorrect. The trivia ends when the total of the questions stored have been answered. The modules used for this
program was the system module and the random module.

The system module provides access to variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to the functions that
interact strongly with the interpreter. 

The random module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
